Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"},"1097675":{"findings":[{"version":"4.6.1","paths":["pcf-start>browser-sync>socket.io"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=3.0.0 <4.6.2","module_name":"socket.io","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj","cves":["CVE-2024-38355"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.6.2","cvss":{"score":7.3,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L"},"updated":"2024-06-20T14:14:52.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.6.2 or later","cwe":["CWE-20","CWE-754"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097675,"references":"- https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/security/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj\n- https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/15af22fc22bc6030fcead322c106f07640336115\n- https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/commit/d30630ba10562bf987f4d2b42440fc41a828119c\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-38355\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj","created":"2024-06-19T15:04:41.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"socket.io has an unhandled 'error' event","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nA specially crafted Socket.IO packet can trigger an uncaught exception on the Socket.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.\n\n```\nnode:events:502\n    throw err; // Unhandled 'error' event\n    ^\n\nError [ERR_UNHANDLED_ERROR]: Unhandled error.
