An advisor from Cafcass or Cafcass Cymru will look at your answers as part of their safeguarding checks, and may need to ask you further questions.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">As part of their enquiries they will contact organisations such as the police and local authorities for any relevant information about you, any other person and the children.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">They will submit information to the court before your first hearing. Their assessment helps the judge make a decision that is in the best interests of the children.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">The information you provide in this section will also be shared with the respondents so that they have the opportunity to respond to your allegations.</p>
