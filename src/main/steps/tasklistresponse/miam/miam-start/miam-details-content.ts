            <p>A MIAM is a first meeting with a mediator.</p>
            <p>The MIAM will:
            </p><ul>
              <li>last about an hour</li>
              <li>give you the opportunity to tell the mediator about your situation, and the issues to be decided</li>
              <li>explain the mediation process, and other options for reaching agreements</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <p>At the end of the meeting, the mediator will tell you if your case is suitable for mediation. You can then decide if you want to proceed, or explore other options.</p>
            <p>The benefits of a MIAM are:
            </p><ul>
              <li>less stress and a faster process than going to court</li>
              <li>help with making arrangements over parenting, property and money</li>
              <li>more control over your family's future</li>
              <li>help with putting your children's interests first</li>
              <li>help with moving on to the next stage of your lives</li>
            </ul><p></p>
            <p>The MIAM process works, with agreement reached in over 70% of cases.</p>
