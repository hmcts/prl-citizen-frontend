<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Family Mediation Voucher Scheme</h3>
<p>You may be eligible for the Family Mediation Voucher Scheme. This is a government scheme that provides up to Â£500 towards the cost of mediation for eligible cases.</p>
<p>At your MIAM, your mediator will explain the voucher scheme and you may be offered a voucher if your case meets the scheme's criteria. Not all cases qualify for a voucher.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.gov.uk" class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank">GOV.UK</a> guidance on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/family-mediation-voucher-scheme" class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank">Family Mediation Voucher Scheme</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The MIAM process works, with agreement reached in over 70% of cases.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Exemptions</h3>
<p>You don't need to attend a MIAM if you have a valid reason. For example, you or the children are at risk of harm.</p>
