### prl-citizen-frontend

Updated with Release 4.0

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Running the application requires the following tools to be installed in your environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.0.0 or later
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

#### Running the application

Install dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Bundle:

```bash
$ yarn webpack
```

Run:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

The applications's home page will be available at https://localhost:3001

### Running with Docker

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the frontend container exposing the application's port
(set to `3001` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can visit https://localhost:3001 in your browser.
You should get a very basic home page (no styles, etc.).

## Developing

### Code style

We use [ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)
alongside [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

Running the linting with auto fix:

```bash
$ yarn lint --fix
```

### Running the tests

This template app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io//) as the test engine. You can run unit tests by executing
the following command:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

#### Functional End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Functional end-to-end (E2E) tests are hosted in the [prl-e2e-tests](https://github.com/hmcts/prl-e2e-tests) repository.


Smoke tests from this repository are executed by triggering a build job in Jenkins.

To run E2E tests on your PR build, add the label `enable-prl-e2e-tests`. This will initiate a Playwright smoke test. Developers should add this label when their changes are ready for code review.

The smoke test is run against **AAT** in the master build.


### Security

#### CSRF prevention

[Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://github.com/pillarjs/understanding-csrf) prevention has already been
set up in this template, at the application level. However, you need to make sure that CSRF token
is present in every HTML form that requires it. For that purpose you can use the `csrfProtection` macro,
included in this template app. Your njk file would look like this:

```
{% from "macros/csrf.njk" import csrfProtection %}
...
<form ...>
  ...
    {{ csrfProtection(csrfToken) }}
  ...
</form>
...
```

#### Helmet

This application uses [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/), which adds various security-related HTTP headers
to the responses. Apart from default Helmet functions, following headers are set:

- [Referrer-Policy](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/referrer-policy/)
- [Content-Security-Policy](https://helmetjs.github.io/docs/csp/)

There is a configuration section related with those headers, where you can specify:

- `referrerPolicy` - value of the `Referrer-Policy` header

Here's an example setup:

```json
    "security": {
      "referrerPolicy": "origin",
    }
```

Make sure you have those values set correctly for your application.

#### Troubleshooting

### Managing Preview environment PODs
Make sure you have added the label 'enable_keep_helm' while creating the PR. Otherwise, add the label and re-trigger the build.

### Healthcheck

The application exposes a health endpoint (https://localhost:3001/health), created with the use of
[Nodejs Healthcheck](https://github.com/hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck) library. This endpoint is defined
in [health.ts](src/main/routes/health.ts) file. Make sure you adjust it correctly in your application.
In particular, remember to replace the sample check with checks specific to your frontend app,
e.g. the ones verifying the state of each service it depends on.
